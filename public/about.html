<h1>About Me</h1> <p>Hi, I'm Abdullah AL Maruf, a passionate and self-motivated Computer
   Science and Engineering student at Daffodil International University (DIU). With a 
   creative mindset and a love for problem-solving, I thrive in the fields of UI/UX 
   design, web development, and digital marketing. As an executive member of the 
   Computer Programming Club at DIU and a former student ambassador of the IEEE 
   Student Branch, I actively engage in tech communities and competitions, including 
   'Tech-Off' and 'Unlock the Algorithm.'</p> <p>Beyond academics, I am the founder 
    of <b>North Valley</b>, where I provide professional graphic design services, 
    and the visionary behind <b>North Mart</b>, an emerging e-commerce startup 
    nearing completion. My expertise spans logo & branding, social media marketing, 
    product design, and front-end development using JFrame. I have also completed a 
    Facebook marketing course to strengthen my startup’s digital presence.</p> <p>My 
      journey is driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to learn. Whether it's 
      designing seamless user interfaces, leading projects, or mentoring peers, I 
      always seek to make a meaningful impact. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy 
      gardening, bike riding, and traveling with family and friends.</p> <p>With a 
        dream to establish my own IT firm, I am continuously expanding my knowledge 
        and skills to shape the future of technology. Let’s connect and create 
        something extraordinary together!</p>
